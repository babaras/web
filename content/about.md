#about


At twelve years of age Baba Ras left yard in Jamaica and headed to England taking with him only his musical roots and never say die positive vibrations. He spent his formative years in the UK ducking and diving away from the National Front and immersing himself in the emerging soundsystem culture of the Seventies. Inspired, Baba Ras developed his own talents and made the breakthrough to toast for the likes of Imperial I, Upsetters, Turbo Charge, Saxon, Young Lion as well as Jamaican soundsystem Peoples Choice when he visited home.


As the Law clamped down on the peoples soundsystems and with positive inspirations from Misty in Roots Baba Ras put himself together a band to ensure he could stay connected musically. The Majestic were born and a great success, touring the UK with Reggae legends, Misty in Roots and  playing on supports with Aswad, Mighty Diamonds. After pausing The Majestic   Baba Ras next found himself behind the scenes as part of the tour management team for Daddy Freddy, Tenor Fly, Cutty Ranks and many more throughout the Nineties.


Next up it was time for loving and nurturing, specifically raising family and teaching the local youth how to put together a riddim and a rhyme. During this time he often tested his skills in the studio or live in the then emerging Jungle, Drum N Bass & Dubstep scenes to keep his musical fires burning. 


Perhaps sensing the coming Reggae renaissance, In late 2010 after a chance meeting with Jimmy Page an instant bond was formed. Through Jimmy came guitarist Russell Raisey and upon finding a classy new drummer in Sam Ferrara and Tony (from the first majestic line up)only a phone call away the latest incarnation of THE MAJESTIC was born. as well as forging ahead with whatever MCing opportunities presented themselves.on sounds or in the studio,Baba Ras tours as part of The Majestic,  Spreading positivity, love and unity with some conscious punchy styles uplifting the people and always sees them in demand,at live venues,and festivals. 
Ruff ‘N’ Tuff, no lyrical bluff. No riddim can escape the lashing lyrics of Baba Ras.
